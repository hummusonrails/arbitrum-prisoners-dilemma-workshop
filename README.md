## 🎮 Game Rules: Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma


The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic game theory scenario where two players repeatedly choose between **cooperation** and **defection** over multiple rounds, without knowing the other's choice in each round. This version introduces strategic depth, as players can adapt their choices based on previous outcomes.

### How It Works

1. **Join a Cell**: Players stake ETH to create or join a cell (game instance). Each cell is assigned a random number of rounds (between 2 and 5) for iterated play.
2. **Play Rounds**: In each round, both players secretly choose to **Cooperate** (0) or **Defect** (1). Choices are revealed simultaneously.
3. **Continue or Exit**: After each round, both players must independently decide whether to continue to the next round or exit. The game continues only if both agree and the maximum rounds for the cell have not been reached.
4. **Payouts & Results**: After the final round or if a player exits, payouts are distributed based on the cumulative results of all rounds played in the cell.


### Payoff Matrix (Per Round)

| Your Move | Opponent's Move | Your Payout | Opponent's Payout |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 🤝 Cooperate | 🤝 Cooperate | **1.0x stake** | **1.0x stake** |
| 🤝 Cooperate | 💀 Defect | **0.5x stake** | **1.5x stake** |
| 💀 Defect | 🤝 Cooperate | **1.5x stake** | **0.5x stake** |
| 💀 Defect | 💀 Defect | **0.5x stake** | **0.5x stake** |


### Iterative Strategic Considerations

- **Memory & Adaptation**: Players can adjust their strategy based on previous rounds (e.g., tit-for-tat, always defect, always cooperate).
- **Continuation Decisions**: After each round, both players must opt-in to continue. If either declines, the cell ends and payouts are distributed.
- **Randomized Rounds**: Each cell has a random number of rounds (2-5), so players cannot always predict when the game will end, increasing strategic uncertainty.
- **Mutual Cooperation**: Both players get a fair return (1.0x per round)
- **Mutual Defection**: Both players lose (0.5x per round) - the "tragedy" of the dilemma
- **Mixed Strategies**: The defector wins big (1.5x per round), but the cooperator loses (0.5x per round)

**The Dilemma**: While mutual cooperation yields the best collective outcome, individual incentives push toward defection—especially in the final round!

## Workshop Exercises

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install -r
```

### 2. Start Local Arbitrum Node

> [!NOTE]
> Codespaces users: This is mostly handled for you, but you still need to manually start the devnode.

```bash
cd nitro-devnode
./run-dev-node.sh
```

### 3. Build & Deploy Prisoner's Dilemma Contract

* The Stylus contract is implemented in `contracts/prisoners-dilemma/src/lib.rs`.
* Build and deploy locally:

```bash
pnpm --filter prisoners-dilemma-contract deploy:local
```

* **Important**: Copy the deployed contract address from the output for later use.

### 4. Export Contract ABI (for Frontend Integration)

* Use cargo stylus to export the ABI for frontend integration:

```bash
cd contracts/prisoners-dilemma
cargo stylus export-abi --json > ../../frontend/src/abi/PrisonersDilemma.json
```

* Open the exported ABI file and ensure it contains only the ABI in JSON format.

### 5. Connect Frontend to Contract

* The frontend is in `frontend/`.
* Update the contract address in your `contract.ts` file:

```typescript
// frontend/src/lib/contract.ts
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = '0x...' as `0x${string}`;
```

### 6. Frontend Development Workshop 🌐 (Iterated Game)

> [!TIP]
> **Main Learning Focus**: The contract is complete! Your task is to study and understand the iterated game theory implementation, continuation logic, and Web3 integration patterns.

#### 📚 **Learning Objectives**
- Master strategic game interactions on blockchain
- Understand ETH staking and payout mechanisms
- Learn game state management and real-time updates
- Practice advanced contract interaction patterns
- Explore game theory concepts in practice

#### 🔍 **Study These Game Components**

The frontend demonstrates advanced game mechanics:

**1. Iterated Strategic Decision Making**
- 📋 **Task 1**: Explore the cooperate vs defect choice interface for each round
- � **Task 2**: Study how continuation decisions are handled after each round
- � **Task 3**: Learn how the frontend and contract keep all players in sync across rounds


**2. Iterated Payout Distribution**
- 📖 **Task 1**: Understand cumulative ETH payout calculations across multiple rounds
- ✍️ **Task 2**: Study the payoff matrix implementation per round and for the final cell
- 🎯 **Task 3**: Learn transaction confirmation and state update patterns for multi-round games

#### 🎯 **Iterated Game Theory Learning Points**

**Nash Equilibrium (Iterated)**
- Both players defecting in every round is the Nash equilibrium, but strategies like tit-for-tat can outperform in repeated play.

**Pareto Efficiency**
- Mutual cooperation in every round is Pareto optimal (best collective outcome), but individual incentives and uncertainty about the final round often prevent this outcome.

**Risk vs Reward**
- Cooperation: Safe but vulnerable to exploitation, especially if the other player defects late.
- Defection: Aggressive but may lose out on long-term gains if the other player retaliates.

#### 🚀 **Workshop Tasks**
1. **Play the Game**: Create games and test different strategies
2. **Analyze Outcomes**: Track your wins/losses with different approaches
3. **Study Incentives**: Understand why players might choose each strategy
4. **Test Edge Cases**: What happens with different stake amounts?
5. **Explore Psychology**: How does knowing your opponent affect decisions?

### 7. Start the Frontend (with Real-Time Iterated Game UI)

```bash
pnpm --filter frontend dev
```

## 🧠 Iterated Game Theory Insights

The Prisoner's Dilemma illustrates fundamental concepts in:

- **Economics**: Market competition and cooperation
- **Politics**: International relations and treaties
- **Biology**: Evolution of cooperation
- **Blockchain**: Protocol design and validator behavior

### Strategies to Explore

1. **Always Cooperate**: Optimistic but vulnerable
2. **Always Defect**: Pessimistic but safe
3. **Tit-for-Tat**: Start cooperative, then mirror opponent's previous move
4. **Random**: Unpredictable mixed strategy

### Real-World Applications

- **DeFi Protocols**: Validator staking and slashing
- **DAOs**: Governance participation vs free-riding
- **MEV**: Cooperation vs competition among searchers
- **Layer 2s**: Honest vs malicious operator behavior

## 🧑‍💻 Workshop Tips

- Use different accounts to simulate real multiplayer scenarios
- Try various stake amounts and see how the number of rounds affects decision-making
- Experiment with different strategies and track outcomes across multiple rounds
- Consider the psychological aspects: How does anonymity and round uncertainty affect choices?
- Think about mechanism design: How could the game be modified to encourage cooperation or longer play?

Happy strategizing! 🎯
